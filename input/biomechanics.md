Twenty-four muscle groups, controlled by the various motor and sensory nerve pathways,



$$ \frac{2}{2}  \infty P_0 = \int^{\infty}_{-\infty}x^2dx$$
![adductor](./adductor.png)  
The adductor pollicis is the second last red band muscle in the hand


1. Power grasp
  (The adductor pollicis stabilizes an object against the palm; the hand's position is static.)

  * cylindrical grip (fist grasp is a small diameter cylindrical grasp)
  * spherical grip
  * hook grip (MP extended with flattening of transverse arch; the person may or may include the thumb in this grasp)
  * lateral prehension (this can be a power grip if the thumb is adducted, a precision grip if the thumb is abducted).

2. Precision
