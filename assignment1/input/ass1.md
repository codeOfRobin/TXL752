# Smart Breathable Fabric

Smart fabrics are materials that actively respond to changes in environmental conditions, so as to improve mobility and user comfort. In the "IQ scale" of functional clothing, they usually factor in at 2(or medium), meaning they sense and react automatically to a stimulus.  

Breathability is an important aspect in functional textiles, often governing critical purchase decisions. Breathable fabrics allow for comfort and allow adequate ventilation even in hot and humid environmental conditions. Therefore, it remains a priority for military and industrial applications.  

In this paper, we shall explore the area of smart breathable fabrics, that change their Water Vapour Transmission Rate ( WVTR) according to temperature. We will pay special attention to a specially designed SSP(Stimuli Sensitive Polymer), *poly(N-tert-butylacrylamide-ran-acrylamide)*, coated on cotton fabric.

For reference, we shall use an identically named paper by Ninad S. Save, Manjeet Jassal and Ashwini K. Agrawal.

# Introduction

For the purpose of breathability, we can use coatings and/or laminates to provide necessary properties. Coatings can be of 2 kinds- hydrophobic and hydrophilic. Hydrophilic coatings help in attracting water away from the body(which can later evaporate via diffusion), but they come with a significant risk to the fabric strength of the fabric, especially after several wash cycles. The hydrophobic coatings are microporous having a pore size of 0.1–50 mm, which allow the passage of water vapor but resist the penetration of liquid water. But, they also reduce the WVTR.  

An alternative to all of these can be the use of polymers with hydrophilic and hydrophobic components. In order to prevent washing away, a novel solution was created. This involves creating cross linking chemical bonds between the coating molecules and the substrate. In the case of the SSP, the covalent bonds were between amide groups of the coating and hydroxyl groups of the cotton fabric. Cross linking allows us to ensure the durability of the fabric, while retaining breathability.  


# Features of Experiment

- 1,2,3,4-Butanetetracarboxylic acid (BTCA) will be used as a cross linker.

- Sodium Hypophosphite was used as a catalyst.
- For samples obtained using multiple coatings, the sample was dried subsequent to each coating and cured only in the end after the final coating was dried. The add-on was obtained by calculating % change in the weight of the fabric after drying and curing.
- In order to measure the integrity of the coating, the coated fabrics were subjected to multiple wash cycles.
- It was observed that most of the loss of coating occurs in the first wash itself. This is most probably due to dissolution of soluble components of the coating.
- The data is given below. SSP50-1,2 and 3 represent single, double and triple coated fabric respectively

| Sample        | Add-on (%) (dried weight)           | Ist wash wt loss  | IInd wash wt loss |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| SSP50-1      | 13.36 | 2.3 | Zero |
| SSP50-2     | 22.76 | 11.93 | Zero |
| SSP50-3 | 24.00  | 11.95 |    Zero |

- It was important that coatings would be evenly spread over the coating. This was tested by taking 10cm X 10cm pieces of the fabric and weighing them to ensure consistency.

- Another important thing to note was that traditional measures of fabric integrity were not applicable, as the coating became completely insoluble at those temperatures. So, the conditions had to be changed accordingly.

- An important testing parameter was the transition property, i.e of swelling and deswelling properties when exposed to humid atmosphere. For best breathability, a fabric should do both quickly to avoid microbial buildup.
- In order to test swelling properties, stable water uptake was taken at various temperatures from 6-80 C. The absorbed water by uncoated fabric was found to be 91% at 6􏰂C and 86% at 80􏰂C. The Swelling percentage (which corresponds to the amount of water absorbed by the coating), is

$$ Swelling  = \frac{W_t - W_w - W_d}{W_d} \times 100 $$

-The kinetics of transition was evaluated by immersing the SSP-coated samples in water at 6􏰂C, and recording the % swelling with time as given above. Similarly, the deswelling kinetics was obtained, by placing the swollen coated samples at 80􏰂C and recording the swelling % with respect to time.

- The water permeability was measured by placing the fabric over a cup of water under a controlled environment. As time passed, the water evaporated through the fabric and depending on breathability, more or less water was left in the fabric. The WVTR was therefore, measured by : -

$$ WVTR = \frac{ Weight loss \times 100000 \times 24 }{ t \times 3000} $$


# Results and Discussion

- BTCA appears to provide better coating evenness properties than the more widely used citric acid. This is because the alchoholic group in citric acid may hinder the esterification of the -OH group in cellulose.
- Negligible weight loss in the second coat indicates proper integration of the fabric with the coat.
- It was observed that the single coated fabric (SSP50-1) had the fastest reaction to absorbing water. This may be due to low thickness, so faster diffusion rates into the substrate. The significantly longer time in SSP50-3 can be explained by the much higher add on as well. However, once the swelling plateaued, the final swelling was the same across the sample. This is probably because the sample was just stalling the diffusion, the cotton underneath was still the same. The same can be extrapolated to multiple coats as well. Another observation that can be made is that for future experiments, the researcher should allow the swelling to taper before making any conclusions.
- Deswelling showed more or less the same trend, however, SSP50-1 and SSP50-2 were much closer.
- Reversibility. In order to make conclusions about any hysterisis effects in the water absorption, the samples were subjected to multiple cycles of swelling and deswelling. It is observed that max swelling decreases very slowly across cycles, possibly due to dissolved constituents in water remaining in the fabric core. This shows that these can be used in commercial applications in rapidly changing environments.
- Temperature transition effects were also observed in the samples. No appreciable difference in the samples was observed. This is far different from the sharpness in the glass substrates the author had previously obtained.
- In the tests on water permeability, resistance for transmission was found to be lowest in SSP50-1 and highest in SSP50-3, both after and before washing. Compared to traditional coatings such as polyacrylamide, there were tiny microlevel cracks in the coat. The reason has been chalked up to be air bubbles at the time for application.
- Air permeability decreased rapidly with number of coatings, at an exponential pace(an order of magnitude difference was observed at every level)
- Finally, the WVTR values. There are 2 modes of diffusion -
    * Diffusion directly into the cracks and then through the fabric.
    * Through both coating and fabric.
  SSP coated fabrics have lower WVTR due to hydrobphobic components.
  Also, at lower temperatures, due to swelling, the cracks may close, further decreasing the WVTR. This is however, highly desirable, as at low temperatures, a garment with this fabric incorporated may provide insulation to the wearer. At high temperatures, it may open up the cracks, providing ventilation to the user.

# Conclusion

breathable coatings were produced by a coating solution of the SSP copolymer, poly(N-tert-butylacrylamide-ran-acrylamide::27:73), con- taining 1,2,3,4-butanetetracarboxylic acid as a cross-linker, and sodium hypophosphite as a catalyst on a cotton fabric. The transition temperature of these SSP coatings was found to lie in a range between 15 and 40􏰂C.
