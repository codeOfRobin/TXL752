Water-resistant and moisture-permeable materials may be divided into three main categories - high-density fabrics, resin-coated materials and film-laminated materials


#High density
Usually oxford weave is used. When fabric surface is wetted by water the cotton fibres swell transversely reducing the size of pores in the fabric and requiring very high pressure to cause penetration. Therefore waterproof is provided without the application of any water- repellent finishing treatment.
Capillary action is determined by two fundamental properties of the capillary:
• Its diameter; and
• Surface energy of its inside face.

The smaller the diameter or the greater the surface energy, the greater the tendency of a liquid to move up the capillary. In textile structures, the spaces between the fibres effectively form capillaries. Hence, the narrower the spaces between these fibres, the greater the ability of the textile to wick moisture
Such constructions include fabrics made from micro fibres, which are packed closely together
However, capillary action ceases when all parts of a garment are equally wet.


#Coated/Laminated waterproof breathable fabrics
Polyurethane is used as the coating material. The coatings are of two types:
1) Micro porous membranes. the coating contains very fine interconnected channels much smaller than finest raindrop but larger than water vapour molecules.
2) Hydrophilic membranes.  transmits vapour through mechanism involving adsorption-diffusion and de-sorption

#Materials

## Polyester
Polyester has outstanding dimensional stability and offer excellent resistance to dirt, alkalis, decay, mold and most common organic solvents. Being durable, yet lightweight, polyester has elasticity and a comfortable smooth feel or “soft hand”. These are all important qualities to consumers for a wide variety outerwear and recreational applications. Excellent heat resistance or thermal stability is also an attribute of polyester.

However, most polyester used in base layer clothing is chemically treated so that they are able to wick moisture. This can be done by:
• Coating the polyester with a hydrophilic finish; or
• Changing its surface chemistry to improve its wetting by moisture.

The result is a de structuring of water, causing wetting. The combination of opposing properties-a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic surface-creates a fabric in which the fibres encourage moisture to migrate through the fabric along the outer surface of the filament while the hydrophobic core does not absorb moisture.

##Polypropylene
Polypropylene
Polypropylene cannot wick liquid moisture. However, moisture vapour can still be forced through polypropylene fabric by body heat.
Also, polypropylene is more oleophilic (oil absorbing) than polyester Consequently, it has a greater tendency to attract and hold oily bod) odours even more.

Nylon
Nylon fibre characteristic include lightweight, high strength and softness with good durability. Nylon also quickly when wet. Nylon is good fabric choice when combined with PU coatings. Nylon has a much higher moisture regain than polyester and therefore has better wicking behaviour. It is most often used in tightly woven outerwear, which can trap heat because of low air permeability.
#advantages

It is generally agreed that fabrics with moisture wicking properties can regulate body temperature, improve muscle performance and delay exhaustion. While natural fibres such as cotton may be suitable for clothing worn for low levels of activity, synthetic fabrics made of nylon or polyester are better suited for high levels of activity.

In removing the liquid sweat from the skin, some textile manufacturers claim that moisture absorbency of the fibre is important and hence cotton or viscose is a necessary compone-nt for the sportswear, which is next to skin.

In fact, so far as cotton is concerned, the synthetics should be preferred in clothing of active sports as they do not retain moisture and this has the advantage of keeping garments lighter than the cotton when it is wet. Also synthetic fibres have some added advantage of quick dry and good shape retention property.

#Multiplayering Of fibres


Push-pull fabrics are bicomponent materials composed of a non-absorbent hydrophobic material on the inside-worn next to the skin-and an absorbent hydrophilic material on the outside. Usually, the hydrophobic material is polyester, and the absorbent hydrophilic material nylon

The wool fibre next to the skin attracts perspiration vapour molecules, before they have the chance to condense into liquid, and disperses them into the atmosphere. The fabric has attracted the attention of top Australian athletes and the Manchester United soccer team. Its major drawback, however, is that it takes longer to dry because of its wool content.


Field Sensor21: Field Sensor is a very popular high performance fabric from Toray, which employs a multi. layer structure that not only absorbs perspiration quickly but also trans. ports it up to the outer layer of fabric very rapidly using principle of capillary action. It is composed of coarser denier yarn on the inside surface (in direct contact with skin), and fine denier hydrophobic polyester yarn in a mesh construction on the outer surface to accelerate quick evaporation of sweat


    A small Colorado-based company, Voormi, is touting a technology that produces a waterproof, breathable textile with only a single layer of material. It could be the most significant advancement in outdoor clothing since the first Gore-Tex jacket

“Our angle is to streamline waterproof breathables into a single-layer construction,” says Timm Smith, Voormi’s marketing director. “So it’s 1978 all over again and we just hit the re-start button.”

On their own, membranes are pretty fragile. So textile companies laminate the membrane to an outer shell fabric to create a two-layer (2L) textile that can then be cut and stitched into jackets or pants or sleeping bag shells. Most of the time, a third layer—a liner—is added to further improve durability. Fun fact: often that liner layer is polyester tricot, the same material you find in bras.

All of that makes a reasonably functional piece of clothing. But it’s also heavy and bulky due to the layers of fabric, the laminate adhesive, and yards of seam tape needed to cover stitch holes. And all the layers can blunt the membrane’s breathability, making it less effective.

Voormi’s new technique gets rid of the lamination altogether. “Rather than glue a membrane to a fabric, we put the membrane into a knitting machine, knitting a yarn in and around and through the membrane, so we get a single-layer textile with a (membrane) core that’s constructed in the process,” says Smith. “It’s an entirely new platform.

They can “tune” the membrane’s properties—the balance of waterproofness versus breathability, which is a function of the size of the pores in a membrane. If they’re designing a fabric for a cold but dry environment, like Voormi’s Colorado home, “maybe we cure the membrane back to 70 percent of its waterproofness,” he says. “The ability to custom-balance that level is part of the engineering.”

hat’s why many jackets still have zippered vents. In fact, the standards (led by Gore) on what is truly waterproof are so high that Voormi makes no claim that its garments are 100 percent waterproof. But the company does say that, short of a full-on deluge, they’ll keep you dry, and that they’re more breathable and comfortable than traditional waterproof shells.
