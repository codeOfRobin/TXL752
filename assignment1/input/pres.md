Water-resistant and moisture-permeable materials may be divided into three main categories - high-density fabrics, resin-coated materials and film-laminated materials


#High density
Usually oxford weave is used. When fabric surface is wetted by water the cotton fibres swell transversely reducing the size of pores in the fabric and requiring very high pressure to cause penetration. Therefore waterproof is provided without the application of any water- repellent finishing treatment.
Capillary action is determined by two fundamental properties of the capillary:
• Its diameter; and
• Surface energy of its inside face.

The smaller the diameter or the greater the surface energy, the greater the tendency of a liquid to move up the capillary. In textile structures, the spaces between the fibres effectively form capillaries. Hence, the narrower the spaces between these fibres, the greater the ability of the textile to wick moisture
Such constructions include fabrics made from micro fibres, which are packed closely together
However, capillary action ceases when all parts of a garment are equally wet.


#Coated/Laminated waterproof breathable fabrics
Polyurethane is used as the coating material. The coatings are of two types:
1) Micro porous membranes. the coating contains very fine interconnected channels much smaller than finest raindrop but larger than water vapour molecules.
2) Hydrophilic membranes.  transmits vapour through mechanism involving adsorption-diffusion and de-sorption

#Materials

## Polyester
Polyester has outstanding dimensional stability and offer excellent resistance to dirt, alkalis, decay, mold and most common organic solvents. Being durable, yet lightweight, polyester has elasticity and a comfortable smooth feel or “soft hand”. These are all important qualities to consumers for a wide variety outerwear and recreational applications. Excellent heat resistance or thermal stability is also an attribute of polyester.

However, most polyester used in base layer clothing is chemically treated so that they are able to wick moisture. This can be done by:
• Coating the polyester with a hydrophilic finish; or
• Changing its surface chemistry to improve its wetting by moisture.

The result is a de structuring of water, causing wetting. The combination of opposing properties-a hydrophobic core and a hydrophilic surface-creates a fabric in which the fibres encourage moisture to migrate through the fabric along the outer surface of the filament while the hydrophobic core does not absorb moisture.

##Polypropylene
Polypropylene
Polypropylene cannot wick liquid moisture. However, moisture vapour can still be forced through polypropylene fabric by body heat.
Also, polypropylene is more oleophilic (oil absorbing) than polyester Consequently, it has a greater tendency to attract and hold oily bod) odours even more.

Nylon
Nylon fibre characteristic include lightweight, high strength and softness with good durability. Nylon also quickly when wet. Nylon is good fabric choice when combined with PU coatings. Nylon has a much higher moisture regain than polyester and therefore has better wicking behaviour. It is most often used in tightly woven outerwear, which can trap heat because of low air permeability.
#advantages

It is generally agreed that fabrics with moisture wicking properties can regulate body temperature, improve muscle performance and delay exhaustion. While natural fibres such as cotton may be suitable for clothing worn for low levels of activity, synthetic fabrics made of nylon or polyester are better suited for high levels of activity.

In removing the liquid sweat from the skin, some textile manufacturers claim that moisture absorbency of the fibre is important and hence cotton or viscose is a necessary compone-nt for the sportswear, which is next to skin.

In fact, so far as cotton is concerned, the synthetics should be preferred in clothing of active sports as they do not retain moisture and this has the advantage of keeping garments lighter than the cotton when it is wet. Also synthetic fibres have some added advantage of quick dry and good shape retention property.

#Multiplayering Of fibres


Push-pull fabrics are bicomponent materials composed of a non-absorbent hydrophobic material on the inside-worn next to the skin-and an absorbent hydrophilic material on the outside. Usually, the hydrophobic material is polyester, and the absorbent hydrophilic material nylon

The wool fibre next to the skin attracts perspiration vapour molecules, before they have the chance to condense into liquid, and disperses them into the atmosphere. The fabric has attracted the attention of top Australian athletes and the Manchester United soccer team. Its major drawback, however, is that it takes longer to dry because of its wool content.


Field Sensor21: Field Sensor is a very popular high performance fabric from Toray, which employs a multi. layer structure that not only absorbs perspiration quickly but also trans. ports it up to the outer layer of fabric very rapidly using principle of capillary action. It is composed of coarser denier yarn on the inside surface (in direct contact with skin), and fine denier hydrophobic polyester yarn in a mesh construction on the outer surface to accelerate quick evaporation of sweat


    A small Colorado-based company, Voormi, is touting a technology that produces a waterproof, breathable textile with only a single layer of material. It could be the most significant advancement in outdoor clothing since the first Gore-Tex jacket

Breathability = garments having a capacity to transfer the moist vapor through the pore of garments

The sportswear is mainly the combination of multilayered fabric. -

Sports garments are mainly made of polyester based fiber due to its good tensile strength & better durability this is tremendously used to produce various kinds of sportswear

The continuous sweating is on in the inner side of the garments, if there is no arrangement of moisture vapor transmission then the vapor will trapped in the micro gap between garments & players skin, in this critical situation the players must face a feeling of discomfort.

Another barrier of this type fabric is to use in European countries, where the players need to have a multilayered garments to protect from extreme cold condition, when the heavy clothes are made of multilayered fabric then the free field’s spaces will reduce which resists the moisture vapor transmission rapidly. To overcome from this unwanted situation two novel techniques is used in sportswear to make the garments breathable by passing through the moisture vapor & perspiration through the garments.

1. Using an inner layer fabric made of special types of PET.(Nonabsorbent)
2. An outer layer fabric that works on diffusion mechanism. (Absorbent)

The garments may be made of "Push-pull" fabrics – bicomponent materials composed of a non-absorbent material on the inside and an absorbent material on the outside -- have proved to be an effective construction for moisture management fabrics. This is because the absorbent material on the outside draws the moisture away from the skin while the nonabsorbent material keeps the skin dry.

 terephthalate fabric is used, which has a special shape that enhances the capillary action helps to keep a dry contact surface between the human body & garments.

 Better evaporation means wearer spend less energy to cool his body, which increases his performance and endurance.

 Consequently, they pick up moisture more readily than hydrophobic fibers. For this reason, fabrics with many narrow capillaries, such as microfibers, are ideal for moisture transport.


 Water-resistant and moisture-permeable materials may be divided into three main categories - high-density fabrics, resin-coated materials and film-laminated materials - which are selected by manufacturers according to the finished garment requirements in casual, athletics, ski or outdoor apparel.


 One of the famous waterproof breathable fabrics known as VENTILE was manufactured by using long staple cotton with minimum of spaces between the fibres

Usually combed yarns are weaved parallel to each other with no pores for water to penetrate

When fabric surface is wetted by water the cotton fibres swell transversely
reducing the size of pores in the fabric and requiring very high pressure to cause
penetration. Therefore waterproof is provided without the application of any waterrepellent
finishing treatment


## Coated waterproof breathable fabrics

The coatings are of two types:
1) Micro porous membranes
2) Hydrophilic membranes.
In microporous membrane the coating contains very fine interconnected channels
much smaller than finest raindrop but larger than water vapour molecules.
Hydrophilic coatings is same as hydrophilic membrane but the difference between the
microporous and hydrophilic material is the former water vapour passes through the
permanent air-permeable structure whereas the later transmits vapour through
mechanism involving adsorption-diffusion and de-sorption.

No single fibre or blend of different fibres can give ideal sportswear. The right type of
fibre should be in the right place. Blending of fibres does not give the same effect as
that of multi-layer fabric. The wicking behaviour of the fabric is mainly depending on
its base fibres moisture properties.

Hydrophilic fibres have a high surface energy. Consequently, they pick up
moisture more readily than hydrophobic fibres-
• Hydrophobic fibres, by contrast, have low surface energy and repel moisture.


Being durable, yet
lightweight, polyester has elasticity and a comfortable smooth feel or “soft hand”.

It is the fibre used most commonly in base fabrics for active
wear because of its low moisture absorption, easy care properties and low cost.
Polyester is essentially hydrophobic and does not absorb moisture. However, most
polyester used in base layer clothing is chemically treated so that they are able to wick
moisture. This can be done by:
• Coating the polyester with a hydrophilic finish; or
• Changing its surface chemistry to improve its wetting by moisture

Changing the surface chemistry of the polyester involves introducing free hydroxyl
groups into molecules on the surface of the filament. The result is a de structuring of
water, causing wetting. The combination of opposing properties-a hydrophobic core
and a hydrophilic surface-creates a fabric in which the fibres encourage moisture to
migrate through the fabric along the outer surface of the filament while the
hydrophobic core does not absorb moisture.


The main disadvantage of chemical or molecular modification is that it is more costly
for the fabric manufacturer. However, the effect on the fabric is "permanent".

Toray12 develops airfine Fieldsensor which is made from a polyester filament yarn
which has the grooves help the fabric absorb sweat quickly and disperse it along the
surface. Company claims that the moisture absorbing and dispersing property of the
new material is twice a great as its former Fieldsensor fabric.



It has been found that frictional force required for fabric to move against sweating
skin (resulting from physical activities, high temperature and humidity of
surroundings) is much higher than that for movement against dry skin due ot clinginess


In fact, so far as cotton is concerned, the synthetics should be preferred in clothing of
active sports as they do not retain moisture and this has the advantage of keeping
garments lighter than the cotton when it is wet


Adding Lycra to a
fabric gives it stretch and recovery, particularly in gymnastics and swimwear where
body skin flexing and stretching are inevitable. Lycra T-9026 requires still effort for
the same extensibility.


Sportswool29, a trade mark of The Woolmark Company, is an example of a fabric
which has been engineered to manage moisture. Developed by scientists in 1994, it is
a hybrid material composed of a fine Merino wool sub-layer for Insulation and a
polyester exterior which draws moisture away from the wool layer to the surface.
material on the inside-worn next to the skin-and an absorbent
hydrophilic material on the outside. Usually, the hydrophobic material is polyester,
and the absorbent hydrophilic material nylon.

The wool fibre next to the skin attracts perspiration vapour molecules, before they
have the chance to condense into liquid, and disperses them into the atmosphere. The
fabric has attracted the attention of top Australian athletes and the Manchester United
soccer team. Its major drawback, however, is that it takes longer to dry because of its
wool content.


A small Colorado-based company, Voormi, is touting a technology that produces a waterproof, breathable textile with only a single layer of material. It could be the most significant advancement in outdoor clothing since the first Gore-Tex jacket



“Our angle is to streamline waterproof breathables into a single-layer construction,” says Timm Smith, Voormi’s marketing director. “So it’s 1978 all over again and we just hit the re-start button.”

On their own, membranes are pretty fragile. So textile companies laminate the membrane to an outer shell fabric to create a two-layer (2L) textile that can then be cut and stitched into jackets or pants or sleeping bag shells. Most of the time, a third layer—a liner—is added to further improve durability. Fun fact: often that liner layer is polyester tricot, the same material you find in bras.

All of that makes a reasonably functional piece of clothing. But it’s also heavy and bulky due to the layers of fabric, the laminate adhesive, and yards of seam tape needed to cover stitch holes. And all the layers can blunt the membrane’s breathability, making it less effective.

Voormi’s new technique gets rid of the lamination altogether. “Rather than glue a membrane to a fabric, we put the membrane into a knitting machine, knitting a yarn in and around and through the membrane, so we get a single-layer textile with a (membrane) core that’s constructed in the process,” says Smith. “It’s an entirely new platform.

They can “tune” the membrane’s properties—the balance of waterproofness versus breathability, which is a function of the size of the pores in a membrane. If they’re designing a fabric for a cold but dry environment, like Voormi’s Colorado home, “maybe we cure the membrane back to 70 percent of its waterproofness,” he says. “The ability to custom-balance that level is part of the engineering.”

hat’s why many jackets still have zippered vents. In fact, the standards (led by Gore) on what is truly waterproof are so high that Voormi makes no claim that its garments are 100 percent waterproof. But the company does say that, short of a full-on deluge, they’ll keep you dry, and that they’re more breathable and comfortable than traditional waterproof shells.
